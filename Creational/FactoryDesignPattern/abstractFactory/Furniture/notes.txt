A. What Is the Core Concept?
If your main concept is the category of furniture (e.g., Modern, Vintage, Luxury), 
then the factories should focus on categories, 
and each factory would produce multiple types of furniture in that category.

If your focus is on the specific type of furniture (e.g., Table, Sofa, Chair),
then your factories should focus on producing variations of that type of furniture, 
and each type of furniture factory could offer different categories.


B. Anticipate Future Changes
For New Categories: 
    If you anticipate adding new categories (like LuxuryFurniture, MinimalistFurniture), 
    then it's better to stick with a factory structure like ModernFurnitureFactory, VintageFurnitureFactory, etc., 
    because each factory deals with a specific category and can be easily extended with new product types within the same category.

For New Furniture Types: 
    If your goal is to specialize in specific types of furniture, 
    like adding many different types of tables (e.g., CoffeeTable, DiningTable, ConsoleTable), 
    then it might make sense to focus on factories like TableFurnitureFactory, ChairFurnitureFactory, etc.


C. How to Implement the Factory
Factory Per Category: 
    If you're grouping by categories, 
    you would likely have a factory interface that creates a family of furniture items for each category (e.g., ModernFurnitureFactory creates a ModernSofa, ModernTable, ModernChair).

Factory Per Furniture Type: 
    If you're grouping by furniture type, 
    each factory would create different variations of that type (e.g., TableFurnitureFactory creates DiningTable, CoffeeTable, EndTable).


Conclusion:
    The choice depends on the structure of your product catalog and future growth considerations.
